# 🛡️ Identity & Access Management (IAM) Strategic Templates

This repository contains a collection of **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** templates, implementation guides, and roadmaps designed to support Zero Trust Architecture initiatives in compliance with **ISO 27001, SOC 2, and HiTrust**.

## 📋 Key IAM Templates

### 🧩 Template 1: IAM Risk Register (Zero Trust Aligned)
| Field | Example |
|-------|----------|
| **Risk ID** | IAM-001 |
| **Risk Description** | Over-permissioned identities |
| **Affected Domain** | Access Control |
| **Likelihood / Impact** | High / High |
| **Current Control** | Role-based access |
| **Residual Risk** | Medium |
| **Recommended Mitigation** | Shift to attribute-based access and enforce least privilege |
| **Owner** | IAM Architect |

**Additional Examples**
| Risk ID | Description | Domain | Mitigation |
|----------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| IAM-002 | Lack of continuous authentication | Authentication | Implement session risk-based reauthentication |
| IAM-003 | Third-party access not monitored | Third-Party Access | Use JIT access and session logging |

### 🏗️ Template 25: Zero Trust IAM Implementation Guide (Azure-Focused)

#### **Phase 1: Assess and Align (Days 1–30)**
- Inventory all user identities (Azure AD, B2B, B2C, third-party IdPs)
- Map current authentication/authorization mechanisms
- Perform IAM maturity gap analysis
- Align IAM program with critical systems and data classification

#### **Phase 2: Harden and Enforce (Days 31–60)**
- Enforce Conditional Access policies (MFA, risk-based sign-in)
- Implement JIT access via Azure PIM
- Transition from RBAC → ABAC
- Disable legacy authentication methods
- Configure federated IdP claim-based access control

#### **Phase 3: Automate and Monitor (Days 61–90)**
- Deploy Lifecycle Workflows for joiner/mover/leaver automation
- Configure Access Reviews for privileged and external users
- Integrate Azure logs with Microsoft Sentinel
- Enable UEBA and continuous monitoring for anomalies

#### **Continuous Improvement**
- Conduct quarterly Identity Risk Reviews
- Review token hygiene (e.g., GitHub PATs, API keys)
- Reassess federated IdP trust posture

### 🗺️ Template 26: IAM Roadmap (Zero Trust Architecture Aligned)

| Quarter | Strategic Objective | Key Milestones | Stakeholders | KPIs |
|----------|--------------------|----------------|--------------|------|
| **Q1** | Establish Zero Trust Baseline | Identity inventory, MFA enforced, maturity model baseline | IAM, Security, Compliance | MFA coverage >95%, 100% identity inventory |
| **Q2** | Implement Adaptive Access Controls | Conditional Access, Risk-based MFA, JIT for Admins | IAM, SecOps | 100% PIM for admins, 80% Conditional Access coverage |
| **Q3** | Govern Third-Party and Federated Access | B2B/B2C trust policies, SCIM, Access Reviews | IAM, Vendor Mgmt | 100% federated IdP reviewed, 90% SCIM coverage |
| **Q4** | Automate Lifecycle and Monitoring | Lifecycle Workflows, UEBA, Log correlation | IAM, SOC, HRIT | 90% automated offboarding, 100% high-risk sign-in alerts tracked |
